# From-Atoms-to-Computers
A series of lessons in which we will build an understanding of the fundamentals of physics, mathematics, and chemistry that make electronics and computing possible.

How exactly do we get to computers from atoms and electrons?

# Introduction

This is an introduction to a series of lessons in which we will build an understanding of the fundamentals of physics, mathematics, and chemistry that make electronics and computing possible.

The goal of these lessons is for us to understand, and give a narration of, exactly what is happening on an atomic scale in electronic circuits that enables them to operate the way they do. We will also develop an understanding of the scientific principles and mathematical definitions that are relevant to electronics.

We will then leverage this fundamental understanding to build our knowledge base towards more complex aspects of electronics. The eventual goal is to give an account of how computers operate from fundamental maths and science—in other words, how we tricked rocks into thinking.

# Why This Series Exists

The reason I’m undertaking this series of lectures stems from a realisation I had after completing my undergraduate studies in Engineering. Even though I acquired knowledge in advanced topics of electronics, I realised I didn’t have as good an understanding of how basic physics and chemistry led to electric circuits and, eventually, computers. Particularly, I had a poor understanding of what exactly was going on with electrons, and electric fields, in wires and electronic components that compels these devices to behave in a manner that allows us to exploit them for power and logical systems.

This series of lectures aims to address this gap in basic understanding.

# Learning in the Age of AI

I hold the somewhat contrarian belief that in a world of LLMs, having good foundational understandings is now of increased importance. I believe it is better to be adept at reasoning from fundamentals rather than being a subject matter expert in an advanced domain. This is because LLMs can consume vastly more quantities of information about a subject than a human could in a 1000 lifetimes - it is impossible to out-read AI, but I’m quite sure it can be out-reasoned.

# Course Structure

So what will we actually cover? We’ll begin with atomic structure and the nature of charge, then progress through

- Electric and magnetic fields and how they interact with matter

- Current, voltage, and resistance at the atomic level

- Basic circuit components and their physical operation

- Semiconductor physics and how we engineer materials to control electron flow

- And eventually, Digital logic and how we create computational systems

I will make available the full course content document once I have completed it. Please subscribe to my YouTube and sign up for my Substack newsletter to be informed when it is available.

# Resources and Materials

The primary texts I’m using for this series are Practical Electronics for Inventors by Paul Scherz and Simon Monk, and The Art of Electronics by Paul Horowitz and Winfield Hill.


Notes and practical exercises will accompany these lessons. Sign up for my newsletter to receive the accompanying materials, including problem sets that will help cement these concepts.

# Looking Ahead

The next upload I post will begin our journey into the world of maths, science and electronics. We’ll start at the very beginning—with the structure of atoms and the nature of electric charge.

Cheers!
